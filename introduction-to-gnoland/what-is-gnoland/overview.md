# Overview

Gnoland is a new smart contract platform based on Gnolang, a fork of Golang. Gnolang inherits the concurrency and developer-friendliness of Golang while fully leveraging the rich libraries and packages that are already available. This approach greatly accelerates application development by allowing dapp developers to reuse and re-assemble existing code, similar to how Cosmos simplified blockchain deployment. Gnoland introduces multiple concepts that together form a scalable, transparent, and sustainable blockchain ecosystem that suggest a viable solution to challenges that existing blockchains are faced with.
